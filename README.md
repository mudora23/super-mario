we use agile development process method.
These are some reasons why we choose agile method. 
Firstly,agile is chosen because the game needs to meet customer needs,agile is based on giving top priority to customer involvement from the very first step of the software development life cycle, allowing customers to participate in the entire process and get products that meet their needs and expectations. 
Secondly,the agile method divides the whole project into many manageable units, which is conducive to better collaboration and testing. In the iterative process, constant detection and modification are conducive to improving the quality of our game products.
The third point is agile,which allows us to focus on only a subset of the product generated in each iteration, thus improving the efficiency of our product.
The fourth point is that Agile can be prioritized by the customer,so we can maximize the business value of the game according to the customer's needs and attract more similar customers.
The main market target is children into young adulthood. 
# software process
First of all, the requirements for game software are established, and the needs and ideas of teenagers for parkour games are investigated. Some ideas that most teenagers want to add to parkour games are collected. The second step is to analyze the feasibility of these ideas and screen out the ideas with high feasibility. The third step is to design the game software, design the interface of the game, the sound of the game, and the design of the game characters and the background. The fourth step is to model some items of the game and complete the initial code of the game operation. Step 5: Test the game and sort out bugs and bugs. Iterate on these five steps until the parkour game meets the needs of the majority of teenagers and finally hits the market.


# algorithm
Before programming, the general direction and risk analysis should be determined, and the initial version made after cost analysis should be released first, and the subsequent software update and upgrade should be carried out, so as to seize the market first and prevent the production of an outdated software. We program the different parts separately, taking the same thing from multiple classes and generating a new class as a rule. Categorize maps, characters, items, everything. It makes it easy to add things later, and does not need to carry out large-scale changes, only need to change the relevant part can achieve the purpose, and realize the software maintainability.

# Futeure plan
There are two patterns. The first mode is mainly educational type. For children under 6 years old, in this mode, it is mainly to help children understand Chinese characters. For every monster in the pass encountered by characters, they need to correctly write the corresponding Chinese characters in pinyin, so as to release skills and defeat monsters. In the second mode, which is mainly entertainment type, customers can collect coins in the game, buy good horses or game characters in the mall, or buy them by topping up. Every level passed will be recorded in the leaderboard, and they can compete with their friends. The one who passes the most levels will become the first place in the leaderboard. And has a special hero character and skin.The game started with only the original ordinary way to pass through, through the avoidance of obstacles to achieve final victory. With the promotion of the game and the current market demand, we will increase the number of levels and add some difficulty and item features to make the game more interesting.Young people like surprises now, so we are going to add some hidden maps for players to explore. In the future, we plan to increase online multiplayer play after meeting the requirements in terms of funding and other aspects.
In the early stage, it creates income through the way of sponsorship and adds the commodities of sponsors into the game in the form of props for the use of players. After having a certain player base, you can create some basic items in the game that you need to buy to help players pass the level. With the development of technology and the progress of society, we will continue to improve our gameplay and content.
