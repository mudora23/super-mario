we use agile development process method.
These are some reasons why we choose agile method. 
Firstly,agile is chosen because the game needs to meet customer needs,agile is based on giving top priority to customer involvement from the very first step of the software development life cycle, allowing customers to participate in the entire process and get products that meet their needs and expectations. 
Secondly, the agile method divides the whole project into many manageable units, which is conducive to better collaboration and testing. In the iterative process, constant detection and modification are conducive to improving the quality of our game products.
The third point is agile, which allows us to focus on only a subset of the product generated in each iteration, thus improving the efficiency of our product.
The fourth point is that Agile can be prioritized by the customer, so we can maximize the business value of the game according to the customer's needs and attract more similar customers.
